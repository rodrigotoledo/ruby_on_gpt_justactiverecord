# ruby_on_gpt_justactiverecord
Our project is a Ruby application that uses `ActiveRecord 7.0` to create a `PostgreSQL` database and a table called `users`. The users table contains three columns: `name` (string), `email` (string, unique), and `age` (integer). The project uses a `Rake`  task to add the age column to the users table. The project was implemented using pure `Ruby`, without the use of the `Rails` framework, and gems were installed directly from the command line.
